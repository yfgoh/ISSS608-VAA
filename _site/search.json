Examples include:\n\ngeom_point for drawing individual points (e.g., a scatter plot)\ngeom_line for drawing lines (e.g., for a line charts)\ngeom_smooth for drawing smoothed lines (e.g., for simple trends or approximations)\ngeom_bar for drawing bars (e.g., for bar charts)\ngeom_histogram for drawing binned values (e.g. a histogram)\ngeom_polygon for drawing arbitrary shapes\ngeom_map for drawing polygons in the shape of a map! (You can access the data to use for these maps by using the map_data() function).\n\nA plot must have at least one geom; there is no upper limit. geom can be added to a plot using the + operator.

It is a useful alternative to the histogram for continuous data that comes from an underlying smooth distribution.\nThe code below plots the distribution of Maths scores in a kernel density estimate plot.\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_density()           \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots two kernel density lines by using color or fill arguments of aes().\n\nggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           colour = GENDER)) +\n  geom_density()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.7.7 Geometric Objects: geom_boxplot\ngeom_boxplot() displays continuous value list.

In this section, a ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure will be further explored.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where one can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs\nFigure in the tabset below shows a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Notice the simplicity of the syntax.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs\nMore complex composite can be plotted using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n/ operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n| operator to place the plots beside each other,\n() operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Creating figure with insert\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, one or several plots or graphic elements can be freely placed on top or below another plot.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\nThe plotThe code\n\n\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()"

    "text": "1.4 Grammar of Graphics\nBefore we getting started using ggplot2, it is important for us to understand the principles of Grammer of Graphics.\nGrammar of Graphics is a general scheme for data visualization which breaks up graphs into semantic components such as scales and layers. It was introduced by Leland Wilkinson (1999) Grammar of Graphics, Springer. The grammar of graphics is an answer to a question:\nWhat is a statistical graphic?\nIn the nutshell, Grammar of Graphics defines the rules of structuring mathematical and aesthetic elements into a meaningful graph.\nThere are two principles in Grammar of Graphics, they are:\n\nGraphics = distinct layers of grammatical elements\nMeaningful plots through aesthetic mapping\n\nA good grammar of graphics will allow us to gain insight into the composition of complicated graphics, and reveal unexpected connections between seemingly different graphics (Cox 1978). It also provides a strong foundation for understanding a diverse range of graphics. Furthermore, it may also help guide us on what a well-formed or correct graphic looks like, but there will still be many grammatically correct but nonsensical graphics.\n\n1.4.1 A Layered Grammar of Graphics\nggplot2 is an implementation of Leland Wilkinson’s Grammar of Graphics.\nA short description of each building block are as follows:\n\nData: The dataset being plotted.\nAesthetics take attributes of the data and use them to influence visual characteristics, such as position, colours, size, shape, or transparency.\nGeometrics: The visual elements used for our data, such as point, bar or line.\nFacets split the data into subsets to create multiple variations of the same graph (paneling, multiple plots).\nStatistics, statiscal transformations that summarise data (e.g. mean, confidence intervals).\nCoordinate systems define the plane on which data are mapped on the graphic.\nThemes modify all non-data components of a plot, such as main title, sub-title, y-aixs title, or legend background."
