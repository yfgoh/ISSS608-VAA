However, the disparities become evident in the older age band. From the 75-79 band onwards, the females increasingly outnumber the males as seen in the 100% stacked bar chart.\n\n### 4.2 Population Size and Age Group Concentrations by Region\n\nThis section explores how the population is spread across different age groups in each region. The stacked bar chart shows the breakdown across five age groups for each region. Additionally, a slope chart shows the proportion of the youth against the senior populations, providing a simple visual of how each region's population skews younger or older.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=1248}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nage_group_plot <- respop_data_clean %>%\n  mutate(Age_Group = cut(Age, breaks = c(0, 14, 24, 44, 64, Inf),\n                         labels = c(\"0-14\", \"15-24\", \"25-44\", \"45-64\", \"65+\"))) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Age_Group)) %>%  \n  group_by(Region, Age_Group) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  mutate(Region = fct_reorder(Region, Total_Pop, .fun = sum, .desc = TRUE)) %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Region, y = Total_Pop, fill = Age_Group)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(title = \"Age Group Distribution by Region\",\n       x = \"Region\", y = \"Population\", fill = \"Age Group\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"0-14\" = \"#FFB6C1\",\n                               \"15-24\" = \"#B3D9FF\", \n                               \"25-44\" = \"#A7D8C7\", \n                               \"45-64\" = \"#FFD1A9\",  \n                               \"65+\" = \"#E0B0FF\")) +  \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n# Second plot (Slope Chart for Youth vs Senior Population)\nyouth_senior_data <- respop_data_clean %>%\n  mutate(Age_Group = case_when(\n    Age <= 24 ~ \"Youth (0–24)\",\n    Age >= 65 ~ \"Senior (65+)\",\n    TRUE ~ NA_character_\n  )) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(Age_Group)) %>%\n  group_by(Region, Age_Group) %>%\n  summarise(Total_Pop = sum(Pop, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") %>%\n  pivot_wider(names_from = Age_Group, values_from = Total_Pop) %>%\n  mutate(\n    `Youth-to-Senior Ratio` = `Youth (0–24)` / `Senior (65+)`\n  ) %>%\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(`Youth (0–24)`, `Senior (65+)`),\n    names_to = \"Group\",\n    values_to = \"Population\"\n  )\n\n# Slope chart plot\nslope_chart_plot <- ggplot(youth_senior_data, aes(x = Group, y = Population, group = Region)) +\n  geom_line(aes(color = Region), linewidth = 1) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = Region), size = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Youth vs Senior Population by Region\",\n       x = \"\", y = \"Population\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n# Combine both plots side by side\nage_group_plot + slope_chart_plot\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n**Insights**\n\n-   The North-East region is the most populous, followed closely by the Central and West regions. In contrast, the East and North regions have significantly smaller populations.\n\n-   The North-East also has the highest proportion of children aged 0–14, reinforcing its reputation as a family-oriented region popular with young households.\n\n-   The Central region has the highest concentration of senior citizens (aged 65 and above), followed by the North-East and West regions, while the North region has the smallest senior population.\n\n-   Age groups of 0-14 and 15-24 remain relatively small across all regions, reflecting a broader national trend of declining birth rates.\n\n-   The Central region stands out with a near-equal number of youths (aged 0–24) and seniors (65+). Despite signs of ageing, each region still has more youths than seniors, highlighting the continued presence of younger populations alongside an ageing demographic.\n\n### 4.3 Regional Age Profiles and Distribution Patterns\n\nTo get a better understanding of the age distribution and variation across the regions, we plot the following boxplot and density ridge plot.\n\n-   The boxplot provides an overview of the age distribution within each region while highlighting the median, mean, interquartiles and range. This allows for easy comparison of the central tendency and spread of ages across regions.\n\n-   Meanwhile, the density ridge plot offers a more nuanced view by visualising the probability density of the age distribution. This reveals the relative density of different age groups across regions, emphasising the shapes and variations in distribution.\n\nTogether, these two visualisation provides a more comprehensive view of the population's age structure, addressing the regional differences.\n\n::: panel-tabset\n## Plot\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Take-home_Ex01_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n## Code\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Boxplot\nrespop_expanded <- respop_data_clean %>%\n  uncount(weights = Pop)\nboxplot_plot <- ggplot(respop_expanded, aes(y = Region, x = Age, fill = Region)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(title = \"Age Distribution Across Regions\",\n       x = \"Age\",\n       y = \"Region\") +\n  stat_summary(geom = \"point\",       \n               fun = \"mean\",         \n               colour = \"#9B2D20\",       \n               size = 4)   +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Central\" = \"#F9E29D\",   \n    \"East\" = \"#D6AEDD\",      \n    \"North\" = \"#F6B6A1\",   \n    \"North-East\" = \"#A9D8C9\",\n    \"West\" = \"#F7A1A0\"      \n  )) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.position = \"none\",\n        )\n\n# Density Ridge Plot\ndensity_ridge_plot <- respop_data_clean %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = Age, y = Region, \n             height = after_stat(density), \n             fill = Region, weight = Pop)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(stat = \"density\", scale = 3, alpha = 0.7, color = \"white\") +\n  labs(title = \"Weighted Age Density Distribution by Region\",\n       x = \"Age\", y = \"Region\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Central\" = \"#F9E29D\",  \n    \"East\" = \"#D6AEDD\",    \n    \"North\" = \"#F6B6A1\",     \n    \"North-East\" = \"#A9D8C9\",\n    \"West\" = \"#F7A1A0\"       \n  )) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))\n\n\ndensity_ridge_plot / boxplot_plot\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n**Insights**\n\n-   All regions show signs of an ageing population, with noticeable age densities continuing into the 60s to 70s.\n\n-   Among the regions, the North stands out with the youngest age profile, with lowest mean and median. Meanwhile, the Central region has the oldest demographic profile, with the highest mean and median, and a wider spread towards older age groups.\n\n-   Both the North and North-East regions have their mean nearly identical to its own median, indicating a relatively balanced age distribution. Additionally, these two regions have a younger skew compared to the other regions.\n\n-   The East and Central regions exhibit broader age distributions into the older age range. Their mean and median are also higher than that of the other regions, suggesting a more mature population.\n\n## 5 Summary and conclusion\n\nThese data visualisation serves as a foundation for telling the story of Singapore's population in 2024. It strives to help readers better understand Singapore's demographic landscape and its regional age patterns.\n\nSingapore's demographic structure in 2024 indicates an ageing population, with most residents aged between 30 to 69 and a shrinking base of younger residents. While the overall gender distribution is relatively well-balanced, females increasingly outnumber males in the older age groups from age 75 onwards.\n\nAcross regions, ageing is evident as well. Notably, the Central region has the oldest demographic, while the North has the youngest demographic. Additionally, the North-East is the most populous with the largest proportion of children aged below 14 and below, cementing its reputation as a place of residence for young families.\n\n## 6 Reference\n\n-   [Singstat](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/population-and-population-structure/latest-data)\n-   [URA Master Plan 2025](https://eservice.ura.gov.sg/maps/?service=MP)\n",
